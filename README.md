Semgrep is an open source (LGPL) static analysis tool for modern dev environments. It's used to enforce meaningful code and security standards ("the paved road") at file-save, commit, and build time. You can [write your own rules]() or run [community rule packs](). Either way, your code is never sent anywhere and is analyzed 100% locally.

Semgrep supports:

| **Python** | **Java** | **Go** | **JavaScript** | **C** | **Ruby** | **TypeScript** | **PHP**   |
| :--------- | :------- | :----- | :------------- | :---- | :------- | :------------- | :-------- |
| âœ…         | âœ…       | âœ…     | âœ…             | âœ…    | ðŸš§       | Coming...      | Coming... |

Semgrep is proudly supported by [r2c](https://r2c.dev). For a fully-supported, hosted version of Semgrep please visit [r2c.dev]().

## Getting Started

Running a Semgrep rule is as easy as:

```sh
$ brew install semgrep && semgrep -e '$X==$X' /path/to/src
```

The Semgrep rule `$X==$X` will find all cases where the left and right hand side of an equality comparison are the same.

Semgrep patterns are very flexible. Learn how to write your own rules at [semgrep.live/learn]()

Want to scan your code with a community rule pack? Install Semgrep and scan code with the default rule pack by running:

```sh
$ semgrep --config=default
```

## Contributing

Semgrep is LGPL-licensed, feel free to help out: [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Semgrep is a frontend to a larger program analysis library named [`pfff`](https://github.com/returntocorp/pfff/). `pfff` began and was open-sourced at [Facebook](https://github.com/facebookarchive/pfff) but is now archived. The primary maintainer now works at [r2c](https://r2c.dev). Semgrep was originally named `sgrep` and was renamed to avoid collisons with existing projects.

## Commercial Support

Semgrep is proudly supported by [r2c](https://r2c.dev). We're hiring!
