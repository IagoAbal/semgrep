Semgrep is a tool for quick and lightweight static analysis. Easily write your own rules or run community rule packs to enforce code and security standards. Semgrep runs locally or in your CI, never sending code or telemetry anywhere.

Get started locally running Semgrep via [Installation & Usage](). For community rule packs and CI integrations visit [semgrep.live]().

## Overview

Semgrep combines the convenient and iterative style of `grep` with the powerful features of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) matcher and intra-file dataflows. Easily find function calls, class or method definitions, and more without having to understand ASTs or wrestle with a regex.

It began as a Facebook project called [pfff](https://github.com/facebookarchive/pfff) in 2009, where it was used to enforce nearly 1000 "paved road" rules on Facebook's codebases. Fast forward to 2019 when [r2c](https://r2c.dev/) revitalized the project after its original author, Yoann Padioleau ([@aryx](https://github.com/aryx)), joined the team. Since its revitalization Semgrep has grown to support many languages including Python, Golang, JavaScript, and Java. It's the latest in a long line of variant analysis and code automation tools with a lineage that connects to [Coccinelle](http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/).

Semgrep exists because:

1. Insecure code is easy to write
2. The future of security involves automatically guiding developers towards a ‚Äúpaved road‚Äù made of default-safe frameworks (i.e. [React](https://reactjs.org/) or Object-relational Mappers)
3. `grep` isn‚Äôt expressive enough and traditional static analysis tools (SAST) are too complicated/slow for paved road automation

The AppSec, Developer, and DevOps community deserves a static analysis tool that is fast, easy to use, code-aware, multi-lingual, and open source!

### Design Choices

Semgrep is optimized for:

- **Speed**: Fast enough to run on every build, commit, or file save
- **Finding bugs that matter**: Run your own specialized rules or choose OWASP 10 checks from the [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.live/r). Rules match source code at the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) level, unlike regexes that match strings and aren't semantically aware.
- **Ease of customization**: Rules look like the code you‚Äôre searching, no static analysis PhD required. They don't require compiled code, only source, reducing iteration time.
- **Ease of integration**. Highly portable and many CI and git-hook integrations already exist. Output `--json` and pipe results into your existing systems.
- **Polyglot environments**: Don't learn and maintain multiple tools for your polyglot environment (e.g. ESLint, find-sec-bugs, RuboCop, Gosec). Use the same syntax and concepts independent of language.

Semgrep emphasis on speed has led to its focus on per-file analysis. As a result, Semgrep doesn't support complex interprocedural dataflows, which are time intensive and costly to compute.

### Pattern Syntax

One of the most unique features of Semgrep is its simple rule writing. Its goal is to make it as _easy as possible_ to go from an idea to finding instances of code that match your thinking. Quick one-off searches can then be made "production ready" and added to the development workflow via pre-commit or CI (see [integrations]()).

For example, to audit for all calls to `exec` in your Python codebase, run:

```bash
$ semgrep -e 'exec(...)' --lang py .
```

This matches on code like the following:

```py
# Semgrep matches simple cases that grep also finds
exec(some_var)

# Semgrep also matches code with whitespace that grep misses
exec (foo)

# And Semgrep matches calls across multiple lines that grep also misses
exec (
    bar
)
```

This can be taken further with additional syntax, such as:

| **Pattern**                                                        | **Match**                                                    |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`$X == $X`](https://semgrep.live/20B)                             | `if (node.id == node.id): ...`                               |
| [`requests.get(..., verify=False, ...)`](https://semgrep.live/jqn) | `requests.get(url, timeout=3, verify=False)`                 |
| [`os.system(...)`](https://semgrep.live/1W5)                       | `from os import system; system('echo semgrep')`              |
| [`$ELEMENT.innerHTML`](https://semgrep.live/9ze)                   | `` el.innerHTML = "<img src='x' onerror='alert(`XSS`)'>"; `` |
| [`$TOKEN.SignedString([]byte("..."))`](https://semgrep.live/rXW)   | `ss, err := token.SignedString([]byte("HARDCODED KEY"))`     |

A [multi-pattern YAML syntax]() then lets you combine simple patterns using boolean logic to create powerful rules for continuous scanning:

```yaml
id: flask-insecure-cookie
patterns:
  - pattern: flask.response.set_cookie(...)
  - pattern-not: flask.response.set_cookie(..., httponly=True, secure=True, samesite='Lax', ...)
message: |
  Flask cookies should be handled securely by setting `secure=True`, `httponly=True`, and `samesite='Lax'`.
```

See [Installation](#installation) and [Workflows](#workflows) to learn more.

### Exit Codes

`semgrep` may exit with the following exit codes:

- `0`: Semgrep ran successfully and found no errors
- `1`: Semgrep ran successfully and found issues in your code
- \>=`2`: Semgrep failed to run

## Workflows

Semgrep supports three primary workflows:

- Run pre-built rules
- Writing custom rules
- Run Semgrep continously in CI

The following sections cover each in more detail.

### Run Pre-Built Rules

The easiest way to get started with Semgrep (other than [semgrep.live](https://semgrep.live/)) is to scan your code with pre-built rules.

The [Semgrep Registry](https://semgrep.live/r) contains rules for many programming errors, including security issues and correctness bugs. Security rules are annotated with CWE and OWASP metadata when applicable. OWASP rule coverage per language is displayed below.

<p align="center">
    <img width="600" src="https://web-assets.r2c.dev/semgrep-rules-owasp-coverage-20200520.png" style="max-width:100%;" />
</p>

You can use pre-built [Rule Packs](https://semgrep.live/packs), that contain sets of rules grouped by language and/or framework:

```bash
$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.live/c/p/java
$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.live/c/p/python
$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.live/c/p/golang
$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.live/c/p/javascript
...
```

Or you can run all of Semgrep's default rules for all languages as appropriate (note: each rule says what language it's for, so Semgrep won't try to run a Python rule on Java code).

```bash
$ semgrep --config=r2c
```

You can also run a specific rule or group of rules:

```bash
# Run a specific rule
$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.live/c/r/java.spring.security.audit.cookie-missing-samesite

# Run a set of rules
$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.live/c/r/java.spring.security
```

All public Semgrep rules can be viewed on the [Registry](https://semgrep.live/r), which pulls the rules from YAML files defined in the [semgrep-rules](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules) GitHub repo.

Here are some sample vulnerable repos to test on:

- Django: [lets-be-bad-guys](https://github.com/mpirnat/lets-be-bad-guys), [django.nV](https://github.com/nVisium/django.nV)
- Flask: [Vulnerable-Flask-App](https://github.com/we45/Vulnerable-Flask-App)
- Java: [WebGoat](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat), [OWASP Benchmark](https://github.com/OWASP/Benchmark)
- NodeJS: [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop), [DevSlop Pixi](https://github.com/DevSlop/Pixi)
- Golang: [GoVWA](https://github.com/0c34/govwa)

### Writing Custom Rules

One of the strengths of Semgrep is how easy it is to write rules.

This makes it possible to:

- Quickly port rules from other tools.
- Think of an interesting code pattern, and then find instances of it in your
  code.
- Find code base or org-specific bugs and antipatterns - things that built-in
  checks for existing tools won't find because they're unique to you.
- and more!

#### Simple Rules

For iterating on simple patterns, you can use the `--lang` and `--pattern`
flags.

```bash
$ semgrep --lang javascript --pattern 'eval(...)' path/to/file.js
```

The `--lang` flag tells Semgrep which language you're targeting and `--pattern` is the code pattern to search for.

#### Advanced Rules

Some rules need more than one line of pattern to express. Sometimes you want to express code patterns, like: `X` must be true AND `Y` must be too, or `X` but NOT `Y`, or `X` must occur inside a block of code that `Y` matches.

For these cases, Semgrep has a more powerful and flexible [YAML syntax](docs/configuration-files.md).

You can run a single rule or directory of rules specified in YAML by:

```bash
$ semgrep --config my_rule.yml path/to/dir_or_file

$ semgrep --config yaml_dir/ path/to/dir_or_file
```

**Example Advanced Rule**

Say you are building a financial trading application in which every `Transaction` object must first be passed to `verify_transaction()` before being passed to `make_transaction()`, or it's a business logic bug.

You can express this behavior with the following Semgrep YAML pattern:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: find-unverified-transactions
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          public $RETURN $METHOD(...){
              ...
              make_transaction($T);
              ...
          }
      - pattern-not: |
          public $RETURN $METHOD(...){
              ...
              verify_transaction($T);
              ...
              make_transaction($T);
              ...
          }
    message: |
      In $METHOD, there's a call to make_transaction() without first calling verify_transaction() on the Transaction object.
```

- `$RETURN`, `$METHOD`, and `$T` are _metavariables_, an abstraction that Semgrep provides when you want to match something but you don't know exactly what it is ahead of time.
  - You can think of _metavariables_ like a [capture group](https://regexone.com/lesson/capturing_groups) in regular expressions.
- The `pattern` clause defines what we're looking for: any method that calls `make_transaction()`.
- The `pattern-not` clause _filters out_ matches we don't want; in this case, methods where a transaction (`$T`) is passed to `verify_transaction()` before `make_transaction()`.
- The `message` is what's returned in Semgrep output, either to STDOUT or as a comment on the pull request on GitHub or other systems.
  - Note that _metavariables_ can be used to customize messages and make them
    contextually relevant. Here we're helpfully telling the user the method
    where we've identified the bug.

You can play with this transaction example here: https://semgrep.live/4b4g.

**Learn More**

- See the [pattern features docs](docs/pattern-features.md) for more info and
  examples on the flexibility and power of Semgrep patterns.
- See the [YAML configuration file docs](docs/configuration-files.md) for
  details on all of the keys that can be used and how they work.

### Run Semgrep Continously in CI

Many integrations already exist and are documented in [docs/integrations.md](docs/integrations.md).

Semgrep provides a CLI, binaries, and Docker images to be portable and easily consumed across environments. It supports JSON output with the `--json` flag and the standardized Static Analysis Results Interchange Format ([SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/cs01/sarif-v2.1.0-cs01.html)) with the `--sarif` flag.

The easiest way to integrate Semgrep into GitHub hosted projects is with the [Semgrep GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/semgrep-action). This action is configured to only report issues _newly_ introduced by a pull request, not pre-existing issues. This significantly increases the liklihood people fix the issues they're shown in CI.
