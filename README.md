Semgrep tl;dr:

* Semgrep is a customizable, lightweight, static analysis tool for finding bugs
* Can run in CI, pre-commit, or in the editor
* Batteries included with [hundreds of existing community rules]()
* Combine the speed + customization of grep with the expressiveness of traditional/heavyweight static analysis tools
* Runs offline, on uncompiled code, fast and open source!
* No painful DSL, patterns look like the source code youâ€™re targeting

Semgrep supports:

| **Python** | **Java** | **Go** | **JavaScript** | **C** | **Ruby** | **TypeScript** | **PHP**   |

Semgrep is proudly supported by r2c. Learn more about a hosted version of Semgrep with an enterprise feature set at [r2c.dev]().

## Getting Started

The best place to start with Semgrep is with its online tour: [semgrep.live/tour](). If you skip the tour, [Use Cases]() will give you a high level sense of Semgrep's applications for DevSecOps.

Semgrep can be installed using `brew`, `pip`, or `docker`:

```sh
# For macOS:
$ brew install semgrep

# On Ubuntu/WSL/linux, we recommend installing via `pip`
$ pip3 install semgrep

# To try Semgrep without installation run via Docker
$ docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/src" returntocorp/semgrep --help
```

Once installed, Semgrep can be run with quick patterns or entire rule packs:

```sh
# Check for Python == where the left and right hand sides are the same (often a bug)
$ semgrep -e `$X==$X` --lang=py path/to/src

# Run the default rule pack with rules for many languages
$ semgrep --config=default path/to/src
```

## Design Choices

Semgrep is optimized for:

- **Speed**: Fast enough to run on every build, commit, or file save
- **Finding bugs that matter**: Run your rules or community rule packs from the [Semgrep Registry](_https://semgrep.live/packs). Rules match source code at the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) level, unlike regexes that match strings and aren't semantically aware.
- **Ease of customization**: Rules look like the code youâ€™re searching, no static analysis PhD required. They don't require compiled code, only source, reducing iteration time.
- **Ease of integration**. Highly portable and many CI and git-hook integrations already exist. Output `--json` and pipe results into your existing systems.
- **Polyglot environments**: Don't learn and maintain multiple tools for your polyglot environment (e.g. ESLint, find-sec-bugs, RuboCop, Gosec). Use the same syntax and concepts independent of language.

Semgrep emphasis on speed has led to its focus on per-file analysis. As a result, Semgrep doesn't support complex interprocedural dataflows, which are time intensive and costly to compute.

## Contributing

Semgrep is LGPL-licensed, feel free to help out: [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Semgrep is a frontend to a larger program analysis library named [`pfff`](https://github.com/returntocorp/pfff/). `pfff` began and was open-sourced at [Facebook](https://github.com/facebookarchive/pfff) but is now archived. The primary maintainer now works at [r2c](https://r2c.dev). Semgrep was originally named `sgrep` and was renamed to avoid collisons with existing projects.
